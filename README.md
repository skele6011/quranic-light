## What is Quranic Light?
This is a web application that was made using html, css, and js. It's main focus is to help hifdh students by allowing them to be tested on random ayat from the picked surah (or a range of them).
It's completely free and open source, always willing to take suggestions @ my discord (skele6011). Honestly, I can't be bothered to make it's own email for questions, suggestions, etc. This is mainly because this is a very small application, there's barely anyone using it. 
## Who is Quranic Light for?
As I mentioned before, hifdh students. If you study the Qur'an or memorize it, this is very good for retaining your memory of it. Reading a surah from start to finish is different from continuing from a random ayah, so this definitely helps in making **YOUR** hifdh overall better.

Have fun & Benefit of it in sha Allah ❤️
